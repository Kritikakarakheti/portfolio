    projectTitle: "End TB",
    projectDescription:
      "The End TB project, led by the dedicated team from Incubate Nepal's 2023 cohort, is a vital initiative to address the pressing issue of tuberculosis (TB) in Nepal. TB is an airborne disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and it remains a global health challenge, with millions of people affected and a significant number of deaths annually. In Nepal, TB is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, and the country is among the 30 high TB burden nations worldwide. The End TB project is driven by a passionate commitment to improving the health and well-being of Nepal's population by comprehensively researching the factors influencing TB outcomes across the diverse provinces. By gathering data from trusted sources, visiting key healthcare institutions, and employing statistical analysis, the team seeks to unravel the complex web of factors contributing to TB outcomes and ultimately contribute to the World Health Organization's End TB strategy. This project represents an important step towards realizing the dream of a healthier Nepal, where the shadow of TB no longer looms large, and a brighter, disease-free future becomes a reality.",

    projectDescription:
      "Incubate Nepal was an 8-week mentored national summer research program, hosted by Harvard and MIT alumni. I was selected for this research project from a competitive pool of 800+ applicants. Under the mentorship of Ojaswi Pandey (an alumnus of Middlebury College and data Scientist), we built AASHA Nepal, a Mental Health Resource Platform that constitutes an app and a website that acts as a reliable link between patients and professional therapists. Understanding the difficulty in finding affordable professionals in the local area, the project expanded to include a location tracking feature, thereby connecting individuals with the right help when they need it the most. Beyond this, AASHA introduced elements like motivational content, transformation stories, and relaxation tools, recognizing the importance of holistic mental well-being. Their focus on adolescents and young adults, as highlighted by their survey spanning 900+ responses from across the country, sheds light on the specific stressors and issues affecting this age group. With the project's determination to bring positive change to people's lives, it promises to be a valuable asset in the realm of mental health in Nepal.",

    projectDescription:
      "The 1166 Helpline Project, established in Nepal, stands as a critical lifeline for those in need of mental health support and suicide prevention. Recognizing the pressing need to address the increasing rates of suicide in the country, this initiative was brought to life through collaborative efforts involving the World Health Organization (WHO), the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) Nepal, and the Ministry of Health and Planning (MoHP). With the introduction of the 1166 Helpline, individuals facing emotional distress, thoughts of suicide, or other mental health issues can now access immediate crisis support and counseling services. This project not only provides an essential entry point for individuals seeking help but also reflects a broader commitment to fostering mental well-being and ensuring equitable access to mental health services for all in Nepal.",
