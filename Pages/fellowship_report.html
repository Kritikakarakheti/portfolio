            <h2>Young Leaders <span style="color: #D04C5E;">Fellowship Report</span></h2>
            <p>My community issue was concerned with mental health including behavioral and emotional disorders,
                anxiety disorders, and depression among youths. It is a serious problem. Affected by several factors,
                youths get bizarrely upset,
                downhearted, and depressed inconsistently when the root cause of the problem is still undiscovered.
            </p>
            <p>Most college-age students or young adults (14-24) are vulnerable to mental health-related issues. I
                believe,
                this age group is most likely to get into these types of problems since they easily get affected, sad
                and
                worried about life events. Some minor circumstances can also contribute to anxiety and depression.
                It’s very essential to find out the cause of the problem and solve it as soon as possible before it
                extends.
            </p>
            <p> <span id="dash">My mission <span style="color: #D04C5E;">statement was,</span></span> <br>
                “Address the root cause of mental health-related problems and promote happy youths.”
            </p>
            <p><span id="dash">My vision <span style="color: #D04C5E;">statement was,</span> </span><br>
                “Creating the community where mental health is valued, promoted and protected, to attain high level of
                peace, love, and happiness all over.”
            </p>

            <p class="bold1">Report of Survey taken from <span style="color: #D04C5E;">5 different individuals:</span></p>
            <p id="bold">Survey <span style="color: #D04C5E;">No. 1</span></p>
            <div class="bullet-point1">
                <ol start="1">
                    <li>What do you see as the most serious issue in the community affecting you?</li>
                    <span>I feel like the issue of depression and anxiety is widely spreading among youths like me.
                        Several social issues and distractions due to social media are extremely dangerous. I often
                        get saddened and depressed while I use social media and begin to compare my life with other’s
                        comfort zone.
                        Sometimes, a small family issue can also harm mental health.
                    </span>
                    <br>

                    <li>Why do you see this as the most serious issue for you?</li>
                    <span>I consider this issue as my biggest reason to feel demotivated most of the time. It always
                        lags
                        me behind resulting in extreme anger issues. I frequently lack confidence and prefer to stay
                        alone
                        avoiding conversations.
                        Time and again, I get negative vibes with no self-assurance and the fear of failure.</span>

                        <br>

                    <li>What do you believe is the best solution to the issue?</li>
                    <span>At first, I think, we should change our negative mindset and build some positivity.
                        Avoiding social media has somewhat helped me a lot throughout my mental health journey.
                        It’s always essential to create awareness
                        among people to follow their hearts and be themselves.</span>

                        <br>
                        
                    <li>How would you participate in the proposed solution (talk about the solution you proposed in the
                        application)?</li>
                    <span>As I said, I would love to create awareness among people on how essential it is to promote and
                        protect
                        mental health. I agree with the point of finding out the root cause of the problem before
                        heading toward the
                        solution.
                        Last but not least, it is always good to listen to others.</span>
                        <br>

                    <li>What do you do to escape from any kind of anxiety you suffer from?</li>
                    <span>I would most likely talk with my close ones. In the worst case, I prefer sleeping. </span>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p id="bold">Survey <span style="color: #D04C5E;">No. 2</span></p>
            <div class="bullet-point1">
                <ol start="1">
                    <li>What do you see as the most serious issue in the community affecting you?</li>
                    <span>The issue of getting distracted by the excessive use of social media is affecting me for some
                        time.
                        I feel like I am less worthy when I see people achieving higher than what I am doing. The
                        anxiety about
                        being able to determine the true passion for something and the career pressure is extremely
                        high. Being
                        an introvert,
                        I feel lonely due to having fewer friends. I won’t be able to express myself.
                    </span>

                    <br>
                    <li>Why do you see this as the most serious issue for you?</li>
                    <span>I get demotivated for not being able to excel in a certain field. Family pressure also occurs
                        when
                        you are affected by so many factors. I get the fear of
                        not being able to cope with the situation. I also feel irritated and annoyed easily.</span>

                        <br>

                    <li>What do you believe is the best solution to the issue?</li>
                    <span>I think being self and not comparing can help. We must have self-reliance. For me, avoiding
                        social
                        media has also helped a lot. The idea of preparing a general routine and progress tracking can
                        also
                        help us to feel
                        motivated and step the right moves. It’s very crucial these days to create mental health
                        awareness. </span>
                        <br>

                    <li>How would you participate in the proposed solution (talk about the solution you proposed in the
                        application)?</li>
                    <span>I would love to participate in this project by creating a group where everyone can open up
                        their feelings, consult and help each other out.</span>
                        <br>

                    <li>What do you do to escape from any kind of anxiety you suffer from?</li>
                    <span>I tend to watch something entertaining. I prefer going in the fresh air. I talk to my close
                        ones or my family.
                        I eat something that makes me feel good.</span>

                    <span>I feel like a lack of proper communication is one of the serious issues.
                        People are self-centric and just limited within a certain group.

                    <li>Why do you see this as the most serious issue for you?</li>
                    <span>It has affected me so deeply. I used to feel isolated, depressed,
                        and saddened. I used to feel difficult to interact with people.</span>

                    <span>People should be open to discussion. Everyone should try giving a slight effort to support
                        others. We should
                        have the mentality of not letting anybody down. There should be freedom to speak.</span>

                        and conducting games can also be a good idea. We can also organize an active participation

                    <li>Why do you see this as the most serious issue for you?</li>
                    <span>A stigma is rooted deeply in our society which labels and shames the victims of mental illness
                        with
                        obscene words and harassment. As much as the treatment of
                        physical illness is crucial, mental health deserves the same, if not more caliber of
                        priority.</span>

                    <li>What do you believe is the best solution to the issue?</li>
                    <span>The best solution begins with you and me advocating mental health in society

                    <span>Bringing up campaigns filled with volunteers and personally backed by Mohp and the government
                        can be an incredible step for a start. Touring various communities, raising
                        voices and such can perhaps cause an effective change in societal perception.</span>

                    <span>In times of anxiety attack, a state of mind where the heart races to and fro, each section of
                        the body incoherently panics and creates a chaotic disturbance. I often tend to stop whatever
                        task
                        on my watch and tend to practice slow breathing.
                        After a decent state of control, I prefer consuming chocolate for instance.

                    <span>Economic differences and Unhealthy competition seems to be the most serious issue adversely
                        affecting me and youths like me.
                        There is a huge rush to seek success in an inappropriate way to earn an ample amount of money.

                    <br>
                    <li>Why do you see this as the most serious issue for you?</li>
                    <span>I believe every people won’t be able to gain maturity early in their lives. Several mental,
                        physical, social, and psychological development happens with the process and the teen is very
                        probable to get into these issues due to not being able to gain maturity and confidence at a
                        certain age. They tend to attain success improperly due to which they often take wrong decisions
                        and couldn’t able to return.
                        We slowly develop insecure nature and disappear from our purpose in life.</span>

                        <br>

                    <li>What do you believe is the best solution to the issue?</li>
                    <span>There should always be an understanding among people. The process of developing a healthy
                        competition should be adapted while being well-interactive and maintaining a friendly
                        environment.
                        We all should
                        have healthy nature and proper counseling need to be there if anybody seeks help.</span>

                        <br>
                    <li>How would you participate in the proposed solution (talk about the solution you proposed in the
                        application)?</li>
                    <span>Often parents don’t get aware and conscious of the child’s psychology due to which there is a
                        high chance of
                        children not being able to well interact with their parents.
                        I would participate in the proposed solution by creating an awareness program and consulting
                        parents. </span>

            <p id="bold">The conclusion <span style="color: #D04C5E;">from the report:</span></p>
            <p>While taking a survey for a mental health project from 5 different individuals, each with their unique
                character,
                I observed some similar elements linking their responses.</p>
            <p>For instance, after conversing with each individual, it was discovered that social media was one of the
                common elements among teenagers. People's real lives have been negatively impacted by their reel lives,
                either directly or indirectly. Youths are frequently demotivated and lack confidence as a result of
                losing their self-identity. They are readily swayed by other people's opinions and bear the dread to
                engage more easily.
                Following this survey to learn more about people's perspectives on mental health, I continued my project
                by conducting additional surveys from a variety of teenagers and college-age students to learn more
                about the common factors from which I can pick one to determine the root cause and work towards
                resolving it.
