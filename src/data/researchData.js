      "An exploratory analysis of factors that affect TB outcomes in Nepal: A report",
    researchDescription:
      "Tuberculosis is a communicable disease  and one of the leading causes of death worldwide and a major cause of ill health [1]. It is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and in Nepal, and the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent (ranking above HIV/AIDS). TB is caused by the Bacillus Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, which is spread when people who are sick with TB expel bacteria into the air; for example, by coughing. The disease typically affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other sites (extrapulmonary TB). An estimated 10.6 million people developed TB and 1.6 million died from TB worldwide in 2021 [2]. About a quarter of the world’s population is infected with M. tuberculosis which is similar for Nepal. Nepal has been listed among the 30 high Tuberculosis (TB) burden countries worldwide. The NTP Prevalence Survey Report 2020 estimated TB prevalence of 416/100000 with around 117000 people living with TB in Nepal [3]. The National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) in Nepal is a program of the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) that is dedicated to achieving the targets of the “End TB” strategy by 2030. Despite consistently high treatment success rates of 90 percent, finding missing TB cases and expanding high-sensitivity diagnostic services remain big challenges in Nepal [4].",

      "Mental Health Status of Middle Adolescents (Age 12-19) - Research Report Analysis",
    researchDescription:
      "Few studies have specifically examined mental suffering or disease, and research on young people's opinions on mental health is still in its infancy. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study that utilized case answers to investigate how the young participants formed their conceptions of what constituted mental illness. The key findings of the study are then discussed concerning how young people classified atypical behavior, their comprehension of the behaviors connected to various mental health issues, and their views toward the persons in question.\n\n According to the National Mental Health Survey conducted by the Nepal Health Research Council from January 2019 to January 2020, 2.2 million students in the age group 16-40 years are estimated to suffer from some form of mental health issue. While the numbers are large, the challenges are made larger by the unawareness and cultural stigma surrounding mental health. As it is reported that almost all mental health issues start from age 14, this study aims to understand the mental health situation of adolescents and young adults (age 12 to age 22). This report involves around 500 responses from all over the country. While the survey does not specifically focus on specific stressors and mental issues, we can analyze the physical care habits, educational mindset, quality of social interaction, use of social media, and social stigma and their roles as stressors.",

    researchTitle: "Fool Your Brain - Research Article",
    researchDescription:
      "The goal of neuroscience has been to comprehend how brain cells generate cognitive abilities. How far has this field of neuroscience come? Thinking about the link between influences and impulses that are stimulated by the brain is based on research into how the brain works. Humans have simple minds. Actually, our brains want to decide rapidly. This is largely motivated by feelings. People frequently use willpower to pick a delayed reward that will be worth more than an immediate benefit that will be worth less. I hypothesized that people's views of their own willpower predict both their anticipated ability to self-regulate and their actual self-regulation the next day. Decisions are made more quickly using this method than using other brains that wish to think and consider. While there are still many unsolved problems, recent advances in several scientific fields have made it feasible to link certain brain network features to cognitive capabilities. The findings imply that perceptions about willpower influence whether expectations are met the day before having favorable or negative effects on people's ability to regulate their behavior. The discoveries show, at least in broad strokes, how cognitive processes might be an emergent characteristic of neurons and their connections.",
