                        <p class="span1">TRING TRING, the sound of my alarm. Oh, it’s already 11 in the morning.
                            And as usual, I don’t feel like waking up. I hurriedly checked my phone.
                            I see no messages popping up on my phone screen and it slowly turned me down.
                            Ugh, nobody cares about me. I am feeling so depressed and I have nobody to
                            share anything.
                            I have a gathering with my friends after an hour but I don’t feel like going out.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>
                            Nobody is interested in listening me. I stare myself at the mirror. I notice the messy hair
                            and my sad personality. I feel low and my confidence is gradually fading away. I can sense
                            the fear of losing everything. I panic sometimes but I feel like there is nothing I can do.
                            I see my dirty room with lots of clutter which is probably not cleaned for weeks. Sometimes,
                            I hardly eat anything and all of a sudden, I start over eating.
                        </p> <br>

                        <p>What if I start showing my depressive sides to anyone? Oh, Never. I will even lose few of my
                            friend which I have and I will remain with nobody. I should show them that I am the happiest
                            one and can adapt easily with them. I put on a fake smile just because I am afraid of the
                            world to identify the real me.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Is that making me happy inside? If the answer is NO. Then, I should probably do something to
                            change this. I should understand that my happiness matters a lot. I have my real
                            self-identity and that’s what makes me unique of all. I should strive hard to create a
                            better version of me. Even if I don’t feel like continuing, I will continue because I know,
                            I am strong. I am worth it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I will wake up early in the morning and make sure I get a good sleep every day.
                            I will take care of my personal hygiene and make sure I am healthy.
                            I will arrange the things at their place and make sure I feel more productive.
                            I will eat healthy and make sure I experience being energized daily.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s ok if I feel low at times. I will share it with my closed ones or my family because I
                            know no matter what, they will always be with me.
                            I know it might take time for me to recover from these regular situation. But I trust that I
                            will get over this soon. I will just not lose hope and carry on……….</p>

                        <p>Oh no! Exam is at hand. If only, I could rote those qBasic programming, some
                            petty definitions and may be a-few-conversions, then I am sure, I am undoubtedly
                            going to secure an excellent score. Is it me during my school? Unequivocally,
                            do you mean computer science by that? The back-breaking subject full of strenuous
                            endeavor and a matter of burdensome exemption. Often this is how learner picturize
                            their mind when their outdated curriculum of computer science is just limited within
                            the pages chock-full
                            of theoretical trauma with gibberish understanding on how will we bring it into play.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>What is the most loved and detest subject by students? It’s surprisingly same,
                            either Math or Computer Science. No, I didn’t say that but the survey did.
                            Most of the students get petrified with computer science as its centre of
                            attraction is just meant for examination. Being less acquainted with rapid
                            growth of technology advancement and upheaval of terminology, they plump for
                            stepping aside unwitting numerous outstanding possibilities. Though everybody
                            is parasite of technology and digital addiction has become part of life, yet
                            we are utterly nescient regarding its sophistication. Besides, our curriculum
                            even lacks egalitarianism. Women are still absent from managerial position
                            supporting that upper-level high perch in lucrative IT industries are yet
                            considered exclusive men’s clubs. This ultimatum that our society has conceived
                            delineates Nepal’s technological backwardness. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I used to be the girl who was entirely
                            ignorant about technology being indistinguishable from magic. Following society’s custom,
                            much like pink color and medical services are for girls, I convinced myself that technology
                            sector is not my cup of tea. Later with a petite interest, I began coding. After
                            comprehending the fact that the apps, websites, portraying as magic into my day-to-day life,
                            can actually be made by oneself, rose my happiness to ecstatic.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Concluding from my story, the change I would like to create for the betterment would be
                            first and foremost, familiarizing everyone with its furtherance and articulating them about
                            how innovative it is, other than just the matter of obtaining grades. Taking your eyes off
                            from something only because you are afraid to start doesn’t seem practical. Initially, my
                            journey to heading off from beginner course was a bit frustrating and now, it has become my
                            passion to learn more and more. “So many things are possible as long as you don’t know they
                            are impossible.”</p>

                        </p>
                    </button>

                    <div id="content3" style="display: none;">
                        <p>Often we are very familiar with the term naming copyright, but what does it exactly
                            mean? Is it similar to piracy?
                            These questions seem very complicated but are simple to be answered when understood.
                            So, copyright basically refers to legal right to copy. It is a type of intellectual
                            property that allows the owner to make the exclusive copies of its creative work.
                            But the copyright infringement occurs when a copyrighted work is replicated, distributed
                            or displayed publicly without the permission of the copyright owner.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>To put it simply, the original work belongs to the one who creates them. And if
                            violation occurs, lawsuits or criminal allegation are charged. By the time,
                            several questions may have arisen like, Is it really a crime? How it happens?
                            How to get away from this issue? So yeah, intentionally using another’s
                            copyrighted material for financial gain is a crime. Copyright protects the
                            owner’s creative work until lifetime of the creator and even 70 years after
                            their death unless it’s a corporation. Though, it’s just a matter of 10 seconds
                            of short clip copyrighted song, it doesn’t take into consideration and we still can’t use
                            it. The only legal way to use such material is to get permission from copyright holder. And,
                            to protect ourselves against copyright infringement claims, we should make sure not to copy
                            anything and document our own work.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>What about Accidental Copyright? It actually comes under Innocent or unknowing copyright
                            infringement where someone engages in infringing activity not knowing that their conduct
                            constitutes infringement. This implies that it is not as worst as intentional copyright but
                            some penalties are charged to it too. Talking about the most common type of copyright
                            infringement, image and text copyright fall at the first place. The moment we create an
                            original image or write something by our own, we automatically gain the rights to it. And no
                            one can violate or use it without our permission.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Moving further, how can copyright claims affect our video? Answering that, it will really
                            have a serious impact on our channel. The copyrighted content from where we were able to
                            monetize, will get removed by the copyright holder. We will no longer be able to live stream
                            from our account. If that’s the case, how to remove copyright claims from our YouTube
                            videos? Surprisingly, YouTube has an awesome feature where it will let us know about any
                            copyright match found in our video before even publishing it out. Isn’t that great? Even
                            after copyright match, if we want to continue publishing our video, we can take the certain
                            actions to remove copyright claim by replacing or muting audio. But what if we publish our
                            copyrighted material? Then, with that condition, the copyright holder has the right to
                            monetize our video for their financial gain.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>But, Wait! Considering, the content has no copyright protection or those whose term of
                            protection has expired then, it enters public domain which can be used without permission or
                            restriction. Creators can also place their content in the public domain if they desire. But
                            we should be a bit careful about the work in public domain where someone else could possibly
                            have made new contribution to it and may be protected by copyright. Although, we normally
                            need permission to use copyrighted material in our work. There is an exception called fair
                            use. It is allowed for criticism, news reporting, teaching, and so on. It is a legal way to
                            re-use copyright protected material without permission of copyright holder.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>While in context of Nepal, intellectual property is divided into two parts, Industrial
                            Property which includes patent for invention, industrial design, integrated circuits,
                            utility models, trademarks and Copyright & Related Rights which covers traditional
